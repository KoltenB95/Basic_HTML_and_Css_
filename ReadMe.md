Here some of the code I wrote over the lenght of my itme taking the Cyber Security course with The Tech Academy.

Over the course of the boot camp I attended a live project course where I was tasked with data analysis, malware traffic, malware detection, as well as linux server information detection.

I was also tasked wtih some hacking objects such as gaining information to a couple OWASP accounts. I will be continue to add more and more projects to this repository as time goes on and my skills grow.
